		<h2>What is a JAVA?</h2>
        <pre style='font-size:20px'>
		A JAVA file is a source code file written in the Java programming language, which was originally developed by Sun Microsystems but is now maintained by Oracle. 
		It uses an object-oriented approach, where structured data types, called classes, are used to instantiate objects at runtime.

		More Information
		JAVA source code files are compiled into .CLASS files using a Java compiler (javac command). 
		A CLASS file contains bytecode that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
		The JVM can be downloaded for every major operating system, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

		NOTE: Android programs are written in Java but are run using the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM),
		which is a different virtual machine than the standard JVM that is optimized for Android.
